### Favourite Models
1. [SOLAR-10.7B-Instruct-v1.0-uncensored](https://huggingface.co/w4r10ck/SOLAR-10.7B-Instruct-v1.0-uncensored)
  - I like SOLAR 10.7B and prefer this uncensored version as it isn't overly concerned about topics.
  - Runs at about 40 tok\s when fully offloaded to vram on my 4070 ti super.
  - Very consistent and doesn't get tangled up, even after long chats.

2. [Westlake 7B v2 laser truthy dpo](https://huggingface.co/macadeliccc/WestLake-7B-v2-laser-truthy-dpo-GGUF)
  - This is an eloquent model with exceptional prose. Great for RP and writing.
  - Takes up about 7GB of vram and runs at a good clip with a 4070 ti super.
