# Azure AI-102 Exam

Here's the approach that I took.

### Study timeline : 
- January 6 through Feb 12
- About 30 minutes to an hour most days of studying.

### My prep : 
- To start, understand which skills are measured : [Azure AI-102 Skills Measured](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/resources/study-guides/ai-102#skills-measured-as-of-february-7-2024)
- Then, I went through all of the Self-PAced learning as suggested by Microsoft.
  - [Link to AI-102 Self-paced training](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/ai-102/#two-ways-to-prepare)
- While going through the self-paced training, [I made a load of notes, here](./nodes.md).
- I also watch [John Savill's AI-102 Study Cram video during this time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7fdWafTcPY)
- Then I went through all of the questions in the ExamTopics AI-101 practice exam material. Highly recommend this for all Azure exams. Besides, it's mostly free.
- Then I went through the practice exams on two separate Udemy bundles. Note that I came to realize that the questions available on these Udemy practice exams were virtually copy and paste from ExamTopics. Or the other way around. Needless to say, they weren't especially helpful, but they do present the questions in a more easily answerable way, I suppose. And it kinda replicates the actual exam maybe too.
- Along the way, I also came across this great book : [AI-102 : Designing and Implementing a Microsoft Azure AI Solution : Study Guide with Practice Questions and Labs - First Edition](https://www.amazon.ca/AI-102-Designing-Implementing-Microsoft-Questions-ebook/dp/B0988751MV)
