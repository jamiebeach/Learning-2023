# Learning-2024

Hello and thanks for checking out this repo! I'm using this repo to catalogue a journey back into the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Let me start with a bit of history. In 2019, I was deeply immersed in AI, spending countless hours studying and exploring this captivating field. It was a time of intense learning and discovery, but as life often does, it brought new challenges and directions. A new job opportunity arose, and my focus shifted, leading me to set aside my AI pursuits.

## 2024: Reigniting the AI Flame
Now, in 2024, it's been five years since my initial deep dive into AI. The field has evolved dramatically, and I'm eager to catch up on all the advancements and innovations that I've missed. So, here's what I have planned:

- **A Blend of Learning Experiences:** I'm set to embark on a variety of courses this year, aiming to refresh my knowledge and delve into the latest developments in AI.
- **Practical Application:** Alongside theoretical learning, I'll be engaging in hands-on projects. This repository will serve as a living document of my progress, featuring code, projects, and perhaps some creative AI experiments.
- **Documenting the Journey:** I plan to transform this space into a personal blog, sharing my daily experiences, thoughts, and insights as I navigate through the vast ocean of AI.

## Why Am I Sharing This?
I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and experiences. If my journey can offer insights, inspire curiosity, or simply provide a companionable narrative to others interested in AI, then this blog will have served its purpose.

## Join Me on This Adventure!
Whether you're an AI enthusiast, a fellow learner, or just curious about where this journey might lead, I invite you to follow along. Let's explore the ever-evolving landscape of AI together.
