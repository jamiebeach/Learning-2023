In 2019, [I took a deep dive in AI](https://medium.com/swlh/top-5-insights-after-i-spent-100-days-learning-about-artificial-intelligence-b14b44a67134), spending countless hours studying and exploring it all. It was a time of intense learning, but as life often does, it brought new challenges and directions. A new job opportunity arose, and my focus shifted, leading me to set aside my AI pursuits.

My original 2019 AI endevour was initially motivated by [listening to an interview](https://youtu.be/csrgeLio9V4?t=1319) with [Kevin Kelly](https://kk.org/) in which he positioned that, at that time, just picking up some basic knowledge on AI and Machine Learning could place you among the top 0.1% of experts in the field. Inspired, I immediately signed up for the [Coursera Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction#courses) as soon as I got home.

## The Future Happens Very Slowly and Then All at Once

One of Kevin Kelly's more famous quotes also happens to be, "the future happens very slowly and then all at once." I think today, **this resonates more than ever**. The 2020's are, without a doubt, going to mark an exponential explosive technological growth - with it all happening at once.

**And AI will be at the center of it all...**

So now, the beginning of 2024, I am certain that I need to (once again) learn as much about artificial intelligence as I possibly can.

This is the goal. And this github repo will detail the journey.

Here's what I'm planning:

- **A Blend of Learning Experiences:** I'm set to embark on a variety of courses this year, aiming to refresh my knowledge and delve into the latest developments in AI.
- **Practical Application:** Alongside theoretical learning, I'll be engaging in hands-on projects. This repository will serve as a living document of my progress, featuring code, projects, and perhaps some creative AI experiments.
- **Get Certified:** Certifications aren't necessary, but they are a badge to post on LinkedIn to help demonstrate knowledge.
- **Documenting the Journey:** I plan to transform this space into a personal blog, sharing my daily experiences, thoughts, and insights as I navigate through the vast ocean of AI.

## Why Am I Sharing This?
I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and experiences. If my journey can offer insights, inspire curiosity, or simply provide a companionable narrative to others interested in AI, then this blog will have served its purpose.

## Join Me on This Adventure!
Whether you're an AI enthusiast, a fellow learner, or just curious about where this journey might lead, I invite you to follow along. Let's explore the ever-evolving landscape of AI together.
