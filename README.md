# Learning-2024

## About
In 2019, I spent a great deal of time diving into Artificial Intelligence, taking a number of courses and reading many books on tne subject. I was very interested in the subject at the time and my interest lead me to learning much about it, possibly getting to a spot where I was within less than 1% of people in the world who knew as much about the subject. However, in late 2019, I got a new job and focused my time on being successful with it, dropping the extra-curricular activities related to AI.

In 2022, my attention turned to excelling my architecture career by learning and certifying in cloud capabilities. I spent many hours working towards certifications and documented it all here.

During 2023, I spent some time in learning mode, but not nearly as much as I had previously. Now, 2024 and 5 years since my first deep dive into AI, I'm recommitting to spending as much time as I can catching up on the amazing advances since 2019.

I plan on taking many courses this year and documenting my progress in this repo here. Where possible, I will include code and subdirectories with working examples. I also plan on documenting the daily experience in this repo in a blog style.
