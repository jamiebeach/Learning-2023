I go for walks most mornings to kick start the day. This morning was no exception and while getting some steps in, I listened to the first 30 minutes or so of a recently puslished book - [The Coming Wave: Technology, Power and the Twenty-first Century's Greatest Dilemma, by Mustafa Suleyman and Michael Bhaskar](https://www.amazon.com/Coming-Wave-Technology-Twenty-first-Centurys/dp/0593593952). Only that far in and I'm getting quite a picture that this is a great book. It reminds me a bit of Life 3.0 mixed with Superintelligence. Definitely getting the "urgent warning" vibes and looking forward to listening to the rest. I'm headed to Toronto tomorrow so expecting that I'll get quite a bit of listening in then.

- Found some recent books on AI. I've read some great AI books in the past, including Life 3.0, Superintelligence. Found some books that I'll start getting into. At first, I found 2084 on Amazon with really positive ratings but then delved into the ratings on Goodreads and found some scathing reviews - "Lennox feels that he can disregard credible scientific information, quote the bible as his source of evidence for ridiculous, completely illogical arguments... And then turn around and act like he himself is a man of science." - yikes!
- Worked through the AI-102 Azure AI Service lab, using an Azure AI container. It's interesting that Microsoft makes their containers available for local runtime and are still able to apply billing back to your subscription. I ran the language detection container on an Azure Container Instance. Which took a really long time to get running. I also found that the first time I ran the service, it took a fairly long time to instantiate and run. Consecutive attempts ran pretty quickly.
- Sidenote : Azure container repo URI : https://mcr.microsoft.com/en-us/catalog?page=1
- I quickly then deleted the container instance to avoid charges.
- Started next module in AI-102 self-paced track, introducing decision support capabilities.
- Did the Analyze Images lab in the self-paced learning track
- Watched another 30 minutes of [John Savill's Azure AI-102 Study Cram](https://youtu.be/I7fdWafTcPY?si=d9l-gEwqddqYiAmx) video - again while working out in my basement gym.

So here I go again. Trying to jam in as much learning as I can about AI. Intending to use this markdown file as a mechanism to blog about it all. Previously when I did this, I documented the whole journey in [Trello, here](https://trello.com/b/g1cS5K0O) and wrote about the top 5 insights I learned, [here in a Medium article](https://medium.com/swlh/top-5-insights-after-i-spent-100-days-learning-about-artificial-intelligence-b14b44a67134). This time, I'm just going to put it all in my github account. This has become the place where I mostly write anyway.

I'm going to commit to 30 minutes per day of learning. This doesn't include writing in the journal here. I'm hopeful to be able to spend considerable more time than that, but I have work and family and I also need to keep my Duolingo streak going ðŸ˜‰.

To start, between last night and this morning, I've spent roughly 1.5 hours on courses.

I have already certified in a number of Microsoft Azure certs, including AI-900, but will go for the AI-102 certification which seems a little more comprehensive than AI-900. Given my background, I expect I'll be able to do this in less than the 40 - 50 hours I've calculated as the bare minimum if you're going in cold. Will see. Certifications always catch me off guard with how much effort I really need to remember it all. I'm also going to have to spend some time brushing up in order to renew my other unrelated certs, due March, so may have to take a break from this.

Besides the AI-102 certification, I'm refreshing everything I learned in 2019 with what looks like a great review course on Udemy called [Machine Learning, Data Science and Generative AI with Python](https://www.udemy.com/share/101W9O3@VqPjR6sljJFflMO_mBMY8Uscvj2cNVU9fw6gIJ3_CPRQtxm9pkSp6Rl7etLlW3dl/) from [Frank Kane at Sundog Education](https://www.sundog-education.com/course/machine-learning-data-science-and-deep-learning-with-python/). This is to start at least, but should take a number of weeks to finish. I'll also explore some podcasts and keep up to date via the various experts I follow on Threads and the YouTube channels I subscribe to. Who knows, I may even do either of those as part of this all.

So this is my first post. If you are reading this, hopefully it all ends up helping or being interesting at least.
